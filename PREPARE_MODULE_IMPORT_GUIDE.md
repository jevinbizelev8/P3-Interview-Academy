# Prepare Module Import Guide

## Steps to Import Your Prepare Module

### 1. File Transfer Methods
Choose one of these methods to transfer your Prepare module files:

**Method A: Manual Copy-Paste (Recommended)**
1. Open your Prepare project in another tab
2. Navigate to each file you want to copy
3. Copy the content and paste into the corresponding file in this project

**Method B: Download/Upload**
1. Download files from your Prepare project
2. Upload them to this project using Replit's file upload feature

**Method C: Git Integration** 
1. If your Prepare project is on GitHub, clone it locally
2. Copy the relevant files to this project

### 2. File Structure Mapping

Copy files from your Prepare project to these locations:

**Pages:**
- `pages/prepare/*` → `client/src/pages/prepare/`

**Components:**
- `components/prepare/*` → `client/src/components/prepare/`

**Database Schema:**
- Prepare-related tables → Add to `shared/schema.ts`

**API Routes:**
- Prepare endpoints → Add to `server/routes.ts`

**Utilities/Hooks:**
- Prepare-specific utilities → `client/src/lib/` or `client/src/hooks/`

### 3. Integration Checklist

After copying files:

☐ **Update imports** in copied files to match this project's structure
☐ **Add Prepare routes** to `client/src/App.tsx` 
☐ **Integrate database schema** into `shared/schema.ts`
☐ **Add API endpoints** to `server/routes.ts`
☐ **Update storage interface** in `server/storage.ts` if needed
☐ **Test navigation** between Prepare → Practice modules
☐ **Update progress tracker** to include all three modules

### 4. Database Migration

If your Prepare module has database tables:
1. Add table definitions to `shared/schema.ts`
2. Run `npm run db:push` to update the database schema
3. Update storage interface methods as needed

### 5. Navigation Integration

The routing is already set up to handle:
- `/prepare` - Prepare module landing page
- `/prepare/*` - All prepare sub-routes
- `/practice` - Current practice module  
- `/perform` - Future perform module

### 6. Shared State Management

Ensure data flows between modules:
- User progress from Prepare → Practice
- Shared authentication context
- Consistent design system

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during import:
1. Check file path mappings
2. Verify import statements match the new structure
3. Ensure database schema is compatible
4. Test each copied component individually
