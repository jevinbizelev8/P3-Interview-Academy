- **Cultural Context**: Appropriate business culture context per language
- **Translation Quality**: Proper differentiation between English and translated content
- **Performance**: ~2.5s per language (acceptable for real-time use)

### 5. Thinking Process Filtering ‚úÖ
- **Response Filtering**: Implemented regex-based filtering for `<thinking>` tags
- **Phrase Detection**: Removes thinking phrases like "let me think about this"
- **JSON Extraction**: Clean JSON-only output to frontend
- **Security**: No internal AI reasoning exposed to users

### 6. End-to-End Workflow Testing ‚úÖ
- **Component Architecture**: 6 frontend components, 6 voice services, 4 backend services
- **API Endpoints**: All prepare-ai routes functional and responding
- **Database Integration**: Phase 1 verification confirmed full compatibility
- **WebSocket Services**: Initialized and ready for real-time communication
