# Old Prepare Routes - Quarantined

These routes were commented out because they depend on the legacy prepare service that has been quarantined. They should be replaced with new AI prepare routes.

## Routes that need to be commented out in routes.ts:

1. Preparation sessions (lines ~1530-1570)
2. Study plan generation (lines ~1575-1615) 
3. Company research (lines ~1615-1650)
4. STAR practice sessions (lines ~1650-1690)
5. Preparation resources (lines ~1695-1760)
6. Progress tracking (lines ~1795-1820)
7. Translation endpoints (lines ~1830-1870)
8. Practice test routes (lines ~2395-2410)

## Replacement Strategy

All these routes have been replaced with:
- `/api/prepare-ai/*` - New AI-powered preparation routes
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time interaction
- Voice processing capabilities
- STAR method evaluation

The new routes provide all the same functionality with AI enhancements.
