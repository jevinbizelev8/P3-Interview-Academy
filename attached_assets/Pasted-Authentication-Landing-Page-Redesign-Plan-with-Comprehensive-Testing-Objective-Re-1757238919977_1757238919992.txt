Authentication & Landing Page Redesign Plan with Comprehensive Testing

    ðŸŽ¯ Objective

    Redesign the landing page and enforce mandatory authentication across all modules to enable comprehensive user tracking
     and session management, with thorough testing to ensure reliability.

    ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks

    1. Landing Page Authentication UI

    - Add Login/Signup Section: Replace "No signup required" messaging with prominent login/signup call-to-action
    - Update Hero Section: Change messaging to emphasize personalized tracking and progress
    - Add Authentication Buttons: Primary "Login" and "Get Started" buttons that redirect to /api/login
    - Update Navigation: Replace direct module links with login-required access
    - Responsive Design: Ensure authentication UI works on all device sizes

    2. Password Recovery Implementation

    - Replit Auth Integration: Since using Replit Auth, password recovery is handled by Replit's system
    - Add "Forgot Password" Link: Redirect to appropriate Replit Auth recovery flow
    - User Instructions: Add helpful text about account recovery through Replit
    - Error Handling: Proper messaging for authentication failures

    3. Module Access Protection

    - Practice Module: Wrap all routes with ProtectedRoute component  
    - Prepare Module: Add authentication requirements to all pages
    - Perform Module: âœ… Already protected (completed in previous work)
    - Update App Router: Add authentication checks before module access
    - Route Guards: Implement consistent protection across all sensitive routes

    4. Enhanced User Experience

    - Landing Page for Authenticated Users: Show personalized dashboard instead of generic landing
    - Progress Preview: Display user's learning progress on landing page when logged in
    - Quick Access: Direct authenticated users to their last activity or recommended next step
    - Loading States: Proper loading indicators during authentication checks

    5. Session Tracking Enhancement

    - Cross-Module Analytics: Extend session tracking to Practice and Prepare modules
    - Unified User Journey: Track user progression across all three modules
    - Activity Dashboard: Enhance perform module to show cross-module statistics
    - Session Persistence: Maintain user state across browser sessions

    6. Development Mode Considerations

    - Environment Controls: Keep development bypasses but make them more obvious
    - Production Security: Ensure all development overrides are disabled in production
    - Testing Access: Maintain ability to test authentication flows

    ðŸ§ª Comprehensive Testing Strategy

    7. Authentication Testing Infrastructure

    - Test User Factory: Create utility to generate simulated user IDs for testing
    - Mock Authentication Service: Implement test-friendly auth service that bypasses Replit Auth
    - Test Database: Set up isolated test database for authentication tests
    - Session Simulation: Create helpers to simulate authenticated and unauthenticated states

    8. Unit Testing Suite

    - Authentication Middleware Tests: Test requireAuth, ensureUser, and validateSessionOwnership functions
    - Frontend Auth Hook Tests: Test useAuth hook with various authentication states
    - ProtectedRoute Component Tests: Verify proper rendering for authenticated/unauthenticated users
    - Session Management Tests: Test session lifecycle, timeout, and cleanup functions
    - Database Query Tests: Verify user-specific data isolation and access controls

    9. Integration Testing

    - End-to-End Authentication Flow: Test complete login â†’ module access â†’ logout cycle
    - Cross-Module Session Persistence: Verify user sessions work across Practice/Prepare/Perform modules
    - API Route Protection: Test all protected endpoints with various authentication states
    - Session Ownership Validation: Test users can only access their own data
    - Error Handling: Test proper error responses for authentication failures

    10. User Experience Testing

    - Login Flow Testing: Simulate multiple user scenarios (new user, returning user, expired session)
    - Module Access Testing: Verify unauthenticated users cannot access protected content
    - Responsive Design Testing: Test authentication UI across different screen sizes
    - Performance Testing: Measure authentication check performance and page load times
    - Accessibility Testing: Ensure login/signup forms meet accessibility standards

    11. Security Testing

    - Session Security: Test session hijacking prevention and secure cookie handling
    - Data Isolation: Verify users cannot access other users' data through API manipulation
    - CSRF Protection: Test protection against cross-site request forgery
    - SQL Injection Prevention: Test database queries for injection vulnerabilities
    - Authorization Testing: Verify role-based access controls (admin vs user)

    12. Test Data Management

    - Simulated User IDs: Create consistent test user identities (test-user-001, test-user-002, etc.)
    - Test Scenarios: Define specific test cases for different user types and authentication states
    - Database Fixtures: Create reproducible test data for consistent testing
    - Cleanup Procedures: Ensure test data doesn't pollute production environment
